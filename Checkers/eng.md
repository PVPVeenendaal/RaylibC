# Checkers

Checkers is a two-player strategy game where players aim to capture all of their opponent's pieces or block them from making any moves. 

## Setup 
	•	Equipment: The game is played on a 64-square checkerboard, using only the dark squares. Each player has 12 pieces (discs).
	•	Placement: Pieces are placed on the first three rows of dark squares closest to each player. The board should be positioned so that each player has a dark square in their bottom-left corner.
	•	Starting Player: The player with the darker-colored pieces (usually black or red) moves first. 

## Movement and Capture 
	•	Basic Movement: Pieces, initially called "men" or "pawns", can only move one square diagonally forward toward the opponent's side to an unoccupied square.
	•	Capturing (Jumping): A player can capture an opponent's piece by jumping diagonally over it to an empty dark square immediately beyond it. The captured piece is removed from the board.
	•	Mandatory Captures: If a player is able to make a capture, they must do so. This rule is a core part of standard American Checkers.
	•	Multiple Jumps: If a jump lands a piece in a position where another immediate capture is possible, the player must continue jumping within the same turn. Jumps can change direction (zigzag) during a multi-jump sequence, but a man must always jump forward. A piece cannot jump over its own pieces or jump the same piece twice in one turn.
	•	Choosing a Jump: If a player has more than one piece that can make a jump, they can choose which piece and which sequence to move. 

## Kings 
	•	Becoming a King: When a piece reaches the last row (the "king row" or "home row") on the opponent's side of the board, it is "crowned" and becomes a king. This is usually indicated by placing another captured piece of the same color on top of it.
	•	King Movement: Kings are more powerful; they can move and capture diagonally both forward and backward.
	•	King Jumps: Kings can combine forward and backward jumps in a single turn. 

## Winning and Ending the Game 
The first player to meet any of the following conditions wins the game: 
	•	The opponent has no pieces left on the board.
	•	The opponent has pieces left, but all of them are blocked and cannot make any legal moves. 
A draw can be declared if neither player can force a win, which typically occurs in specific end-game scenarios or by mutual agreement.
