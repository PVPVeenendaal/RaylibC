# Draughts

Draughts is a board game in which you take turns moving diagonally forward on dark squares; capturing is mandatory if possible, with multiple captures (capturing multiple pieces) taking precedence, even over creating a king. A piece that reaches the back row becomes a king and may also move backward and jump multiple squares. The goal is to capture or block all of the opponent's pieces.

## Basic Rules
Board Setup: The board is arranged so that the bottom left square is dark.

Moves: Pieces move diagonally forward one square to an empty dark square. White begins.
Touching is Moving: If you touch a piece that allows you to make a legal move, you must move that piece (touching is moving).

## Capturing
Mandatory: If you can capture an opponent's piece, you must do so (capturing is mandatory).
How: Jump over an opponent's piece to an empty square directly behind it. The captured piece is removed from the board.
Multi-capture: If, after a capture, the piece is in a position to capture again (a "chain capture"), you must continue capturing. Multi-capture takes precedence (even if you capture more pieces with a regular piece than with a king).

## King (Promotion)
Create: Reach the opponent's back row with a piece. Place a second piece on top (a king).
Power: A king can move both forward and backward and jump over multiple empty squares.
Capture: A king can also capture in any diagonal direction and can land on any empty square behind the captured piece (not necessarily directly behind it).
King Capture vs. Multiple Capture: If you can capture an equal number of pieces with a king and a regular piece, you may choose. A king capture does not trump a multiple capture.

## Winning
You win when you have captured all of your opponent's checkers, or when your opponent can no longer make a legal move.

## 50-move rule
When applicable: After 50 consecutive moves by both players, with no checkers captured and no kings won.
Result: Draw.

## The Three-Move Rule (Three-Way Repetition):
This rule is intended to prevent endless draws, for example, when both players simply move checkers back and forth without actually winning.
Result: Draw.
